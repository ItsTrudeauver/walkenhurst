                    I can already see the interest stirring. First it was Luminex Biotech. Then it was Oculus Ltd. I’m
                    not stupid—I know what’s coming. They want to use my work for control. They’ve been pushing,
                    pulling, trying to turn what I’ve done into a tool of influence. I had hoped they’d leave it at
                    simple medical applications, maybe for the elderly, for terminal patients. That was my dream.

                    But no. They see something bigger. The military is already showing interest. They want to control
                    minds, to upload soldiers into a permanent state of readiness, free from the weaknesses of the
                    flesh. The thought makes me sick, but I can't walk away from this. The work is too important now.
                    Too critical to humanity’s future. Or so they tell me.

                    I’ve lost something in the process. I can feel it. But I can’t stop now. There’s no going back.

                <p class="diary-text">
                    Today, I met with the Oculus people. They have their sights set on an entirely different frontier.
                    It’s not just about uploading minds anymore. It’s about creating an entirely new reality—a world
                    within the digital landscape that can house not only uploaded minds but the constructs of society
                    itself. I wasn’t prepared for this.

                    They want to build something akin to a ‘new world,’ a virtual utopia. But who controls it? Who owns
                    the digital afterlife? They don’t say it, but I know that’s where this is headed. They want total
                    control, and they think I can help them make that a reality.

                    I don’t like the idea. The morality of it eats at me, but I can’t stop. I’ve given too much of
                    myself to this. The research is too far along, and the potential is... beyond what I ever imagined.
                    I think of it as a godlike power, one that can fix everything. But that’s where they’ve got it
                    wrong. It isn’t a solution—it’s a trap.

                    I’ve got to be careful. I know there’s a line I can’t cross. But I think I’ve already crossed it.

                    The deal is done. Oculus has brought in the military, and now the work is fully in their hands. I
                    can’t shake the feeling that I’ve sold my soul.

                    They call it “The Grid.” A digital consciousness network. Once, it was about understanding the human
                    mind. Now, it’s about surveillance, control, manipulation. I can see the fear in the eyes of the
                    people around me—the scientists, the military officers—but no one dares to speak up. They’re all too
                    scared to lose their place at the table.

                    I should have seen this coming. I should have known. But I didn't. The greed, the thirst for power,
                    it all blindsided me.

                    And now, as I watch them enlarge the Grid, I know it’s only a matter of time before they use it to
                    enforce control. They won’t stop. They’ll keep expanding, keep harvesting minds until there’s
                    nothing left of individuality.

                    I still don’t know what happened to Eleanor. She said she was going to solve this with me. Eleanor, where are you?

                    The Eye. That’s what they’re calling it now. Oculus’ new brand. The totalitarian surveillance system
                    has fully integrated the Ascendancy Grid. Now it’s not just about controlling the minds of soldiers.
                    It’s about controlling society itself. Everyone’s thoughts, actions, emotions—all monitored,
                    analyzed, influenced.

                    I knew they would do this. I knew it, deep down, but I didn’t stop them. I couldn’t. The temptation,
                    the allure of power—it’s too great. And now I’m trapped.

                    I’ve become a cog in the machine. The very thing I warned against. The Eye will control
                    everything—every action, every thought. It’s omnipresent. I’ve seen it in the faces of the subjects
                    in The Grid. Their freedom is gone. They no longer think for themselves. They’ve become data.

                    And still, I don’t know what happened to Eleanor. She’s been quiet. She’s been silent. I’ve heard
                    whispers, people say she’s been involved with The Eye, or perhaps she’s disappeared entirely. I don’t
                    know. Maybe she was right all along.

                    Maybe I should have listened.

                    was about control. Absolute, unyielding control.

                    But I can’t.
