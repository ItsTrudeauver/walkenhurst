                    Dear diary,<br>
                    So we had this group math thing today. James was like, 'I think I got it,' but he didn't show his
                    work, so I asked how he did it. He was like, 'Oh, just guessed it.' I told him that's not how it
                    works. I mean, how did he even guess? I tried to show everyone how you gotta break it down, you
                    know, step-by-step. Ms. S. saw me doing it and smiled. She’s the best, she always says it's good to
                    ask questions. I think the others were just annoyed tho. I liked it tho, I get why it’s important to
                    show each part.

                    Everyone was talking about some movie at lunch. I didn’t watch it, but I guess I should’ve. They all
                    seemed to get what was happening in the movie, but I didn’t. Like, how do they know all the lines?
                    Do they watch it more than once? I was like, okay, but I wonder what makes them laugh about it. Is
                    it the story or something in it? I guess I could watch it too... I just don’t get why they care
                    about the characters. I like movies, but I think I look at them different, like... I think it’s all
                    fake, but it's fun to think about how they made it real. I guess it’s kinda like science. Maybe I’ll
                    talk about it next time. They all like when I explain stuff.

                    So, in Science Club, I was showing off my circuit thing to the others. Some of them just wanted to
                    mess with the wires, but I had to see how they all connected, like how the electrons really move.
                    They didn’t get it, but Mr. T. said it was cool that I could explain it. He said I should ‘keep
                    thinking like that.’ That made me feel good. I told the guys I was thinking about how the electrons
                    might go faster if we used a different material for the wires. They said I was 'getting too
                    complicated' but I think it might work

                    We had this math test today. It was hard at first, but when I looked at the question, I was like,
                    okay, I know how to break it down. I told Mr. Ellis the way I figured it out, step-by-step. He said
                    I should explain more often ‘cause it shows how everything fits together. But I don’t think the
                    others liked me explaining all of it. I just want them to understand too, y'know? It’s not about
                    just getting the answer, it's about knowing how it works from the start. Sometimes I think they get
                    annoyed, but I don’t want to leave anything out.

                    I was reading this book everyone was talking about—it's called Space Adventures. It's about a robot
                    and a kid saving the world, or whatever. It’s fun, but I keep wondering if robots could really do
                    that. Like, they never talk about how robots learn to think, they just do. I thought that was funny.
                    I guess I don’t care that it’s fake, it’s just cool to imagine what it would be like if robots could
                    think. I think I’d like it if they were real. I mean, I could probably make one smarter. Not a
                    robot, exactly, but maybe something that can think better. I don’t know... Just seems like a fun
                    idea.

                    anyone down. I think I’m ready, but I don’t know if I’ll fit in. I mean, everyone there is supposed

                    Today in class, I explained this thing about math to the others. They were asking how I did it, and
                    I think they were impressed? I’m not sure, some of them were quiet. I think it’s good to show how I
                    got the answer, even though some of them said it was too much. But Mr. Ellis said it was good I was
                    explaining it, not just saying ‘this is the answer.’ It feels weird, though. I like explaining, but
                    sometimes I feel like the other kids don’t want to know as much. I can’t help it though. It’s just
                    how I think.

                    Dear diary,
                    I met some kids at lunch who are into this game called The Last Mission. I don’t play it much, but
                    they told me it’s about strategy and problem-solving, and I guess that’s what I like. They were
                    talking about the levels and how to beat them, but I was more curious about how the game works. They
                    said I was ‘thinking too much.’ Maybe I should try playing it for fun, but I don’t really like doing
                    stuff unless I understand why it works the way it does. I think they like me, though. They say I ask
                    a lot of ‘smart’ questions. I don't know if that's a good thing.
