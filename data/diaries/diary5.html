                    Today, I showed Dr. Li and Dr. Sorrentino my updated neural map. The way they looked at it—like it
                    was something truly new—was enough to make me feel good about it. They’ve always supported me. Dr.
                    Pereira even gave me the go-ahead to take on a solo project. They’re trusting me with more and more
                    of the work. It’s strange. I know I’m capable. But sometimes I wonder if they’re seeing something in
                    my work that I’m not seeing myself. Everyone talks about how fast I’m catching up to the older
                    students. But I never really think of it like that. I’m just doing what feels right. I feel like I’m
                    starting to understand where the gaps are in our knowledge. It’s strange—sometimes it seems like no
                    one wants to fill them. But I’m ready. I have to push past the ideas people cling to.

                    I had a breakthrough today. Dr. Li was skeptical at first, but when I demonstrated the new process
                    for synaptic digitalization, I could see her eyes light up. It’s funny—no one’s talked about this
                    yet. We’ve been so focused on artificial augmentation that no one’s really considered full
                    integration with biological systems. I feel like I’m starting to think in ways no one else is. It’s
                    exhausting at times, trying to keep up with the workload and research, but it’s worth it. There’s
                    this sense of clarity I can’t explain. I don’t know how to explain it to anyone else. Sometimes I
                    get the feeling they’re still trying to catch up to me. But that’s okay. I’m not in a hurry. I just
                    want to keep learning. And maybe—just maybe—somewhere in all of this, I’ll find something that
                    answers the questions no one else is asking.

                    I’m starting to feel the weight of it all. Not the research—no, the research is exhilarating—but the
                    pace. There’s an intensity to this life that never seems to let up. I spend more time in labs than I
                    do sleeping, and it’s as if time itself is a luxury I’m no longer allowed. The breakthroughs come at
                    the cost of hours spent squinting at screens, making calculations, trying to push the boundaries of
                    what we know.

                    The faculty here are incredible. Dr. Vantag and Dr. Griffiths, they keep pushing me further. They
                    challenge everything I think I know, and I’ve come to appreciate that. If it weren’t for their
                    constant questions, I don’t know where I’d be.

                    I’ve been working on refining the neural interface model. We’re so close to understanding how to map
                    and sync individual synapses with external systems—truly a monumental step toward real neural
                    digitalization. But there’s still something I can’t quite get right. I know I’ll crack it. It’s
                    just... exhausting.

                    No one talks about the fatigue that comes with this kind of work. The people around me—they see me
                    as a prodigy, but what they don’t see is the toll it takes. There’s always more to do, and I wonder
                    sometimes if I’m really pushing the limits or just skimming the surface. Maybe it’s both.

                    I’d been wrestling with this problem for hours. Nothing I did seemed to work. I adjusted the
                    variables, I rechecked the assumptions, but it just wouldn’t align. The data was slipping through my
                    fingers like water.I hadn’t noticed the barista bringing my coffee at first.

                    When I finally looked up, she was finishing her shift. She packed 
                    up her things behind the counter, moving with that practiced efficiency, 
                    and I quickly focused back to my work, still lost in the numbers.

                    She closed up, went behind the counter, and grabbed her stuff to leave. I was so focused on the
                    problem, I barely heard her footsteps when she walked past me and out the door.

                    But just before she left, she glanced at the screen—just a quick look—and muttered something under
                    her breath.

                    "Huh, thought it was point fourty-nine. Guess not."

                    I felt my heart jump. I hadn’t expected that. It was such a small thing, just a number. But
                    how could she have known? The answer was so specific. It was like she had seen my calculations, but
                    how could she have? I stared at the screen, trying to wrap my mind around it. It's a mess on here I
                    lose track time to time.

                    I was about to call out to her, ask her how she knew, but... that would’ve been awkward. Would have
                    been creepy even, asking a barista on her closing shift about
                    biotech mathematics.


                    But as she walked out the door, something caught my eye. I didn't mean to look, I still haven't
                    really made sense of it all. Anyway, I saw her student ID clipped to her bag—just
                    visible as she passed. My gaze lingered for a moment before I realized what I was seeing. It was a
                    Novonne ID card. I froze. I didn’t even need to read the name. I had seen the numbers on the ID. She
                    was two years
                    younger than me. Why would someone that brilliant need this barista job? She could go freelancing
                    for any company. She's a Novonne product, like I am, like Liam and Maya.

                    I looked back at the screen, still barely processing what had just happened. The number she
                    muttered, the
                    casualness of it... It didn’t make sense. When I revisited the calculations, I plugged 0.49 in,
                    instead of 0.52, just as a hailmary.

                    I sat back and stared blankly at the screen. The results were exact. To a hundredth decimal. How? 
                    She saw my screen for a few seconds at most. Was it the reflections in my glasses? No,
                    don't be ridiculous. I was messy and tired then so I overlooked this problem, still I doubt any 
                    ordinary Novonne student could just do that.

                    I didn’t know what to make of it, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had just witnessed
                    something extraordinary."

                    The more I think about that moment, the less I understand. Eleanor (I think that’s her name—just
                    pieced it together from the ID card) didn’t seem out of place. She was a Novonne student, sure, but
                    why would she even be paying attention to my work?

                    But that number. It’s stayed with me.

                    It made everything fall into place. In a way, it felt almost too perfect. I should’ve been annoyed.
                    After all, it was just some barista’s observation. But for whatever reason, it made sense. I did the
                    calculations over and over again, and each time, the numbers matched.

                    Was I looking too deeply into it? Perhaps. But that moment of clarity, that sudden realignment of
                    everything I’d been trying to do, felt like something more than coincidence.

                    I’m starting to realize something—something I’m not sure I want to admit. I’m not just a top
                    researcher anymore. I’m moving into a new realm of influence. People are starting to see me as one
                    of the great minds in the field. And that scares me more than it excites me.

                    I’ve been reflecting a lot on where I am in my work. The progress I’ve made has been monumental, but
                    sometimes I wonder if I’ve lost something along the way.

                    I was in a meeting with some of the top people at Luminex Biotech today. There was a moment when I
                    caught myself, realizing just how much I’ve climbed in this field. Dr. Toland was talking about some
                    new project he wanted me to be a part of—neural integration, next-generation interfaces—and I felt a
                    surge of pride. It’s strange, how far I’ve come.

                    It’s also strange how the universe works. Eleanor—remember her?—she’s here now too, at the company.
                    I couldn’t have expected that. It’s been almost two years since that café encounter, and I hadn’t
                    seen her once since then. She walked into the office like she belonged, no surprise in her step.
                    She’s younger, sure, but there’s a sharpness about her that makes me believe we’re not so different.

                    Still, she has her own path. Her own projects. I’m not sure if we’ll ever work together, but there’s
                    something in the way she challenges ideas that I find intriguing.

                    What did I see that day in the café? Was it just a coincidence, or is there more to it? I haven’t
                    figured that out yet. But I think I’m beginning to realize that I’m not the only one pushing
                    boundaries here.
