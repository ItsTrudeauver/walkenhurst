            Dear Dr. Walkenhurst, <br>

            I hope you're doing well. My name is Jamie Smatchell, and I’m a journalist with Academia Reports. I’m
            reaching
            out for a feature we’re working on about groundbreaking research that has gained traction at an
            extraordinary pace: how such discoveries shape academia, policy, and the broader world.

            Your work in Neural Digitalization has been widely recognized, and we would love to hear your
            insights on what it means to see research move from idea to impact so quickly. We’re particularly interested
            in discussing key aspects of the research, including but not limited to public reception, implications and
            ethics of the research.

            The interview would take approximately 2 months and can be conducted at your convenience via
            phone/video/in person. Please let me know if you'd be open to this, and I’d be happy to coordinate a time
            that works for you.

            Looking forward to the possibility of speaking with you.

            Best regards,
            Jamie Smatchell
            Journalist
            Academic Reports

                Dear Mr. Jamie Smatchell,<br>
                I appreciate your interest in my work and the opportunity to contribute to your feature. However, I
                generally refrain from discussing my research publicly, as I find that certain aspects are difficult to
                simplify in a way that would be appropriate for a news audience.<br><br>

                That said, I encourage you to reach out to my co-authors, Dr. Kormac Lawson and Dr. Antonio Sorrentino,
                who have extensive experience in communicating our work and would be well-equipped to provide valuable
                insights. I trust they can offer the perspective you’re looking for.
                <br><br>
                Best,<br>
                Dr. Erasmus Walkenhurst
