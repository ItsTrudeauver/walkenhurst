            <p>Eleanor and I have been working together on several projects lately, and it’s becoming more clear that
                we’re quite well-matched. We approach problems from similar angles, but there’s a subtle difference in
                our perspectives that makes our discussions...invigorating. It’s not just that we both understand the
                complexities of cybernetics and biomechanics—it’s that we’re both driven by a desire to push boundaries.
                Our debates are intellectual, but they’re not contentious. There’s a mutual respect, even when we don’t
                agree.</p>

            <p>Lately, we’ve been tackling the issue of neural interfaces. It’s exciting, the potential to enhance human
                cognition directly by linking it to machines. It feels like we’re on the cusp of something monumental. I
                suggest one thing, Eleanor pushes it to another height. She is brilliant, always one step ahead. She may
                even be better than me. Yet, when I bring up the idea of uploading human consciousness, her hesitations
                grow. She asks questions that are often rooted in the consequences of such a leap. What happens to the
                self when it’s digitized? What rights do the uploaded minds have? And more than that, what is the cost
                of tampering with the essence of being human? It’s easy for me to push forward, but Eleanor’s concerns
                make me pause, if only for a moment.</p>

            <p>I have a growing sense that we’re on the verge of something that could change everything. </p>
