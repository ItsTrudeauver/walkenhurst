            <p>There it is. Our magnum opus. Our life's work. Humanity's greatest leap.</p>

            <p>The first test case was an instant success. Gamma-9's brain signals are stable. A bit of an adaptation
                glitch, but we fixed the neuro interface. She may well be able to communicate tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Eleanor kept complaining about "ethics." Stickler, that one. Always has to raise the moral question, as
                if that ever built anything. Can she not see that this, right here, is what every scientist dreams of?
                That we've done in years what should have taken decades? And yet, her enthusiasm is... lacking.
                Mismatched with the significance of this. Maybe it's just her. Maybe it's just, well. Hm. Never mind. It
                perplexes me how one so brilliant can also be so hesitant.</p>
