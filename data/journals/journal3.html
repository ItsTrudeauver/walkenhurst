            <p>The research divisions have been assembled. I discussed with Dr. Fausten and Eleanor today about the lead role. </p>

            <p>Dr. Fausten was disinterested, that tracks for him. Told us it's time for him to step down and let the new grass grow. He's only 45, that seems a bit soon.</p>
            
            <p>Eleanor said she does not want it. She does not like the "ethics" of the research. Classic Eleanor, stickler to the rules. Maybe she's too young to really value progress? But I'm not that old either. </p>
            
            <p> I guess that leaves me to be the lead. Eleanor is key for the neuro interface implementations, so guess she's going to be on Dr. Fausten's division. Whatever, it's a cubicle over. </p>
